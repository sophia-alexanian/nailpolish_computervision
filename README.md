## Change style using voice commands!

No need to lower your hands and type lengthy commands or scroll through different combinations to try on nails! Simply press one button and tell it what you want to see!

'C' to say what colour you want (with the whole rainbow available!).
'S' to say what shape you want (before you need to file your nails!).

## Best of all, it's free!

Try on nails for free before paying $$$ to get them done professionally or invest in a new colour of nail polish.

## Sold? Here's how to use on your local machine!

*Note: this tutorial assumes you have the capability to run python scripts on your local machine in terminal*

*steal instructions about cloning from Robert*

This project is dedicated to [Robert Zupancic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-zupancic/), fellow UofT engineering student (and my ECE241 lab partner), who gave me the inspiration for this project.

However, this project was researched, designed, and implemented by Sophia Alexanian (me!).

P.S. Robert and I created a piano and drum kit simulator for FPGA using Verilog for our final ECE241 project. If you're interested in seeing my work in a hardware description language (as opposed to a high-level programming language), feel free to check out our (censored for academic integrity purposes) work [here](https://github.com/RoZ4/Pianissimo-for-the-FPGA).
